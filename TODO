# Todo

Features:

- fix assets
- test validate populated Item - assets is wrong
- re-add MultiPolygon
- move datetime, start_datetime and end_datetime to top-level
- rework properties
- Extensions - EO, View

Validations:

- start_datetime and end_datetime -- dt within sdt edt, null rules
- test geometry and bbox variations
- validate geometry or bbox
- antimeridian checking

-------------------------------------------------------

- common metadata https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/blob/master/commons/common-metadata.md
- benchmarking
- hypothesis
- cli
  - write schema
- robust developing section

- add more validation to item model

- asset thumbnail png, jpeg, jpg, or webp

- allow use of PySTAC Extensions + Augments
- Extensions https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/blob/master/extensions/README.md
  - EO
  - View
- rewrite stactools
- to_pystac methods

- implement Asset additional properties
  - datetime: Provide individual timestamp on an Item, in case the Item has a start_datetime and end_datetime, but an Asset is for one specific time.
  - gsd (Common Metadata): Specify some assets that represent instruments with different spatial resolution than the overall best resolution. Note this should not be used for different spatial resolutions due to specific processing of assets - look into the raster extension for that use case.
  - bands (e.g. in combination with the EO extension): Provide spectral band information, and order of bands, within an individual asset.
  - proj:code/proj:wkt2/proj:projjson (projection extension): Specify different projection for some assets. If the projection is different for all assets it should probably not be provided as an Item property. If most assets are one projection, and there is a single reprojected version (such as a Web Mercator preview image), it is sensible to specify the main projection in the Item and the alternate projection for the affected asset(s).
  - proj:shape/proj:transform (projection extension): If assets have different spatial resolutions and slightly different exact bounding boxes, specify these per asset to indicate the size of the asset in pixels and its exact GeoTransform in the native projection.
  - sar:polarizations (sar extension): Provide the polarization content and ordering of a specific asset.
  - sar:product_type (sar extension): If mixing multiple product types within a single Item, this can be used to specify the product_type for each asset.
  - role - must have data?
    - EO Extension
    - View Extension
    - SAR Extension

Project:

- pypi
- rtd
- codecov

- is lat/long float or decimal? Decimal, and add a configuration for how many points
- replace ItemProperties with flat structure
- don't `stac_` things

Collection & Catalog

- create models
- Check if a Collection asset has a "summaries" property.
- link title
- self link? required?
